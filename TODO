serialization writer
	Takes "Message" property on Dispatch
	and serializes it if not already done
	and then clears out Message property?

web/ResponseWriter helper methods, e.g. status codes with message, etc. etc.
web/constants with mime types, e.g. application/json application/javascript text/xml, text/plain, etc.
